**Description:**

Welcome to the Content Showcase app, a beautifully designed Android application that presents an immersive and seamless experience for exploring a variety of content items.

**Features:**

1. **Content Listing Page:** The app greets you with a visually appealing content listing page, featuring a captivating page title and a vertically scrolling grid. In portrait mode, the grid displays items in 3 columns, and in landscape mode, it expands to 5 columns, making the most of the screen real estate.

2. **Search with Ease:** The search functionality enhances your exploration journey. With a single tap on the Search icon, you can initiate a search and enter your query. The app showcases real-time search results, dynamically updating as you type. However, it ensures search results are displayed only when the query contains 3 or more characters, guiding you effortlessly through the process.

3. **Seamless Lazy Loading:** The app efficiently loads content data from JSON files, residing in the API folder. As you scroll down, the app seamlessly fetches JSON pages one by one, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted scrolling experience. You won't even notice the additional data loading, creating a delightful user experience.


**Architecture and Code Quality:**

The app adheres to the principles of clean architecture, separating concerns into distinct layers. This promotes maintainability and testability while ensuring a well-organized codebase. The MVVM pattern empowers the presentation layer, keeping the UI logic separate from data handling.

Hilt, our dependable dependency injection framework, allows for seamless dependency management, enabling easy scaling and modularity for future enhancements.
